    Markyl or Jaz or Atlas. Any work anymore.
I thought I would have figured this shit out by now, but I was wrong. I’m still questioning and discovering new pieces of myself– like finding new shards of glass left on the floor from a week ago by the sensation of it embedding in the pad of my foot.
I don’t think it’s painful, though.
I think the painful part is when everyone else gets involved. It’s when I have to face stagnation in the face of growth– or more accurately, metamorphosis.
</p>
<p>
    I guess that’s why I’m writing this. I’m hoping that by spilling this out, that painful part will be dulled. It’s always easier to do for others than yourself, y’know?

    So, I hope that through this, you can find pieces of yourself in me. I hope that you can face that stagnation and trudge through it because you know you’re not alone.
